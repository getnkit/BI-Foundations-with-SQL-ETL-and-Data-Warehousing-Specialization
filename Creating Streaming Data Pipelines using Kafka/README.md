# Scenario
You are a data engineer at a data analytics consulting company. You have been assigned to a project that aims to de-congest the national highways by analyzing the road traffic data from different toll plazas. As a vehicle passes a toll plaza, the vehicleâ€™s data like ```vehicle_id```,```vehicle_type```,```toll_plaza_id``` and ```timestamp``` are streamed to Kafka. Your job is to create a data pipe line that collects the streaming data and loads it into a database.
# Objectives
In this assignment you will create a streaming data pipe by performing these steps:
- Start a MySQL Database server.
- Create a table to hold the toll data.
- Start the Kafka server.

- Verify that streamed data is being collected in the database table.
# Results
Start zookeeper server
Start Kafka server
Create a Kakfa topic named ```toll```
Run the ```toll_traffic_generator.py```
Run the ```streaming_data_reader.py```
Health check of the streaming data pipeline.
