# Linux Commands and Shell Scripting - Final Project
## Scenario
You are a lead linux developer at the top-tech company “ABC International INC.” ABC currently suffers from a huge bottleneck - each day, interns must painstakingly access encrypted password files on core servers, and backup those that were updated within the last 24-hours. This introduces human error, lowers security, and takes an unreasonable amount of work.

As ABC INC’s most trusted linux developer, you have been tasked with creating a script ```backup.sh``` which automatically backs up any of these files that have been updated within the past 24 hours.
## Objectives
- The objective of this lab is to incorporate much of the shell scripting you’ve learned over this course into a single script.
- You will schedule your shell script to run every 24 hours using ```crontab```.
- TIP: If you’re unsure whether some of your code will work as wanted, you can try the command directly in the terminal - and even create your own test scripts!
